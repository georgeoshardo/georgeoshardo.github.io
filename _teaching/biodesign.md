Supervised this course from 2022-2024.  The course introduces practical techniques for biodesign. These have originated in the molecular techniques that have become ubiquitous in modern biology. Combined with the growing understanding of biology, we are now able to adapt existing biological systems within cells, or design
non-living systems that make use of biological molecules.

Topics covered
---------------

* Designing genetic circuits, the mainstay of traditional synthetic biology and a core technique when introducing novel functions into cells and organisms.
* Designing nucleic acids and proteins, directed evolution, and rational design techniques.
* Editing genomes, redesigning genomes, rebuilding genomes.
* Designing abiotic systems: molecular programming and synthetic cells.
