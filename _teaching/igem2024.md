Instructed the Cambridge team for the 2023 iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition. The team developed a novel magnetogenetic system for spatiotemporal gene expression control by designing magnet-inducible AND gates and creating open-source hardware (MagentaBOX) for localized magnetic stimulation. This led the team to win their third gold medal in a row at the final competition.
