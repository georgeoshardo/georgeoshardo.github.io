Instructed the Cambridge team for the 2023 iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition. The team engineered *Bacillus subtilis* to form protective biofilms capable of preventing the colonization of harmful bacteria and, for agricultural applications, designed a biosensor for pathogenic biofilm detection.
