## Abstract

Stochastic gene expression causes phenotypic heterogeneity in a population of genetically identical bacterial cells. 
Such non-genetic heterogeneity can have important consequences for the population fitness, and therefore cells implement regulation strategies to either suppress or exploit such heterogeneity to adapt to their circumstances. 
By employing time-lapse microscopy of single cells, the fluctuation dynamics of gene expression may be analysed, and their regulatory mechanisms thus deciphered. 
However, a careful consideration of the experimental design and data-analysis is needed to produce useful data for deriving meaningful insights from them. 
In the present paper, the individual steps and challenges involved in a time-lapse experiment are discussed, and a rigorous framework for designing, performing, and extracting single-cell gene expression dynamics data from such experiments is outlined.
