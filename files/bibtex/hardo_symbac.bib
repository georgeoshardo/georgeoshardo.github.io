	abstract = {Deep-learning–based image segmentation models are required for accurate processing of high-throughput timelapse imaging data of bacterial cells. However, the performance of any such model strictly depends on the quality and quantity of training data, which is difficult to generate for bacterial cell images. Here, we present a novel method of bacterial image segmentation using machine learning models trained with Synthetic Micrographs of Bacteria (SyMBac).},
